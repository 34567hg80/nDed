nDed The lightweight browser

I have developed a lightweight and privacy-focused browser designed for long-term support and compatibility with various Linux, Win32, and Win64 versions. The browser prioritizes minimal memory usage and efficient performance, making it suitable for legacy systems and ARM-based single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi. With strong privacy features such as tracker blocking and fingerprinting protection, user data is safeguarded during browsing. 

The browser adheres to industry standards and modern web technologies to ensure compatibility with a wide range of websites, all while offering a user-friendly interface. By combining lightweight design, robust privacy, and compatibility, my browser provides a fast, secure, and efficient browsing experience for users seeking privacy and speed. 

The browser's use of WebKIT APIs enhances compatibility with modern web applications, and its integration of the PyQt library enables it to run on any device with Python support, further expanding its usability.
